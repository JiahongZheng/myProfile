## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northwestern University, working under the guidance of Professor Kenneth Forbus. My research focuses on artificial intelligence, multimodal reasoning, and cognitive modeling. I am fascinated by how humans perceive, understand, and interact with the world and strive to explore how computational models can capture and simulate these cognitive processes.
